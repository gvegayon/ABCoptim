# ABCoptim: An implementation of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm

This is an implementation of Karaboga (2005) ABC optimization algorithm. It was developed upon the basic version programmed in *C* and distributed at the algorithm's official website (see the references).
  
Any evident (precision) error should be blamed to the package author (not to the algorithm itself).

# Example

```{r example1}
library(ABCoptim)

# Function to optimize. Min at (pi,pi)
fun <- function(x) {
  -cos(x[1])*cos(x[2])*exp(-((x[1] - pi)^2 + (x[2] - pi)^2))
}

# Since it is stochastic, we need to set a seed to get the same
# results.
set.seed(123)

# Finding the minimum
ans <- abc_optim(rep(10,2), fun, lb=-20, ub=20, criter=200)
ans

plot(ans)
```
